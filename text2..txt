 git init
Purpose: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
Explanation: This creates a .git subdirectory that contains all the necessary metadata for version control.
2. git add README.md
Purpose: Stages the README.md file for commit.
Explanation: This command tells Git to track the changes made to README.md and prepare it to be committed.
3. git commit -m "first commit"
Purpose: Commits the staged changes with a commit message "first commit".
Explanation: This creates a snapshot of the changes in the repository and logs the commit message.
4. git branch -M main
Purpose: Renames the current branch to main.
Explanation: The -M flag forces the renaming of the branch, which is often used to change the default branch name from master to main.
5. git remote add origin https://github.com/littleone21131/a3b.git
Purpose: Adds a remote repository named origin that points to the specified GitHub URL.
Explanation: This links the local repository to a remote repository on GitHub, so you can push and pull changes.
6. git push -u origin main
Purpose: Pushes the main branch to the remote repository origin.
Explanation: The -u flag sets origin main as the default upstream branch, so future git push and git pull commands can be used without specifying the remote and branch.
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. Git stores the history of changes, enabling rollbacks and version comparisons. It operates with repositories, which can be local or remote (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab). Git supports branching and merging, making it ideal for collaborative development.
GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for version control, collaboration, and project management. It allows developers to store their code, track changes, and collaborate with others through pull requests, issues, and discussions. GitHub integrates with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools and offers features like wikis, project boards, and code reviews. It is widely used for both open-source and private software development. GitHub also supports GitHub Actions for automating workflows.
repository (or repo) is a storage location where your project files, including code, documentation, and history of changes, are stored and managed. In Git and GitHub, a repository contains all the versions of your project files, allowing you to track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to earlier versions if needed. Repositories can be either local (on your computer) or remote (on a server like GitHub). They include branches for parallel development and are the central unit for version control.
